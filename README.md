Data set
The data set for this project is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/p53+Mutants
Biophysical models of mutant p53 proteins yield features which can be used to predict p53 transcriptional activity. All class labels were determined experimentally.
The data consists of 31781 instances and 5409 attributes per instance. Attributes 1-4826 represent 2D electrostatic and surface based features. 4827-5408 represents 3D distance based features. The 5409th attribute is the class attribute which is either active or inactive. The class labels are to be interpreted as follows: ‘active’ represents transcriptionally competent, active p53 whereas the ‘inactive’ label represents cancerous, inactive p53.
